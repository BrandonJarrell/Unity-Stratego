# Overview
The goal of creating this game was to teach myself how to use the Unity Engine and use it as a tool to teach myself any future idea's I want to visualize or create simply for fun. 

Stratego is a game of guessing your enemy, defending your flag through your own strategy and conquring the enemy's flag.
This game is my personal favorite, and thought it would be fun to play it wherever I want with my friends and brothers instead of having
to carry around the actual board.

My next goal is to add multiplayer over a network, that way it would be more fun and smooth for each player, plus, long distance gameplay would be super fun

I am still figuring out how to add the files in a smooth transition that would allow anyone to open the Unity project and edit it for their own use and modify,
but until then, I just uploaded the scripts and the exported project. Reach out to me for any further information
